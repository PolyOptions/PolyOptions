				<h2 id="About">About</h2>
				<p class="about">PolyOptions was founded in 2022 as a decentralized platform for crypto investors to trade short-term price movements without paying large exchange fees.</p>
				<p class="about">The advantage of PolyOptions is that, unlike most exchanges, users are able to execute trades without paying commissions. Trading on PolyOptions is as simple as connecting a wallet, choosing an asset, and predicting whether it will go up or down a ceratin percentage within a given time. If you're right, you get a large payout. If you're wrong, you lose a percentage of your investment. Trading with PolyOptions is that simple. No commissions. No hidden fees. No hassle. </p>

			<p class="about">All currency data is sourced from cryptocurrency exchanges across the globe</p>
